# Roadmap

Backlog of work for this project. Tasks flow: `ROADMAP.md` → `IN_PROGRESS.md` → `HISTORY.md`.

Each task lives here as a heading with whatever description it needs (acceptance criteria, design notes, sub-tasks). When work starts, move the block to `IN_PROGRESS.md`.

Tasks are derived from the implementation plan in [PLAN.md §12](PLAN.md). Milestone IDs (M1.1, M2.3, …) refer to that plan and are kept in titles for traceability. Always read the referenced PLAN.md section before starting a task.

---

## High Priority

> **Phase 1 — Foundation.** Blocks everything else. A fresh Mac must be able to run `install.sh`, log in to Claude + GitHub, and end with the `atelier` plugin installed and `/doctor` ✅.

---

## Medium Priority

> **Phases 2–5 — Single-project agent flow + robustness + multi-project foundation.** Done when the toy-repo flow can pick a task, implement it, open a reviewed PR, auto-merge it, clean up, and survive failures with retries — and when an operator can install / uninstall atelier without risking unrelated Claude state.

### M5.0.3 — `atelier-uninstall` with chat-session preservation

Today there is no clean way to uninstall atelier. To remove atelier, the operator has to manually:

1. Edit `~/.zshrc` to remove the atelier hooks block (between sentinel comments).
2. `rm ~/.local/bin/atelier-setup-project`.
3. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$ATELIER_CONFIG_DIR claude plugin uninstall atelier@akalab-tech` and `claude-roadmap-tools@akalab-tech`.
4. Decide what to do with `$ATELIER_CONFIG_DIR` — which contains chat history (`history.jsonl`), session state (`projects/`), plans (`plans/`), backups — without a clear convention.

M5.0.3 ships a single command — `scripts/atelier-uninstall` — that automates steps 1–3 and gives the operator a clear default for step 4 (preserve), with an explicit opt-in for destructive wipe.

**Default mode (conservative):**

- Remove the atelier hooks block from `~/.zshrc` and/or `~/.bashrc` (via `sed` against the existing sentinel comments — same comments used at install time).
- Remove the `~/.local/bin/atelier-setup-project` symlink and the new `~/.local/bin/atelier-uninstall` symlink.
- Uninstall `atelier@akalab-tech` and `claude-roadmap-tools@akalab-tech` plugins under `$ATELIER_CONFIG_DIR`.
- **NOT removed:** `$ATELIER_CONFIG_DIR` itself. The operator's chat history, sessions, plans, backups all remain in place. They can still `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-work claude` (or whatever the chosen path was) later to access archived sessions, even though atelier is no longer "installed" on their system.

**Purge mode (`--purge` flag):**

- All of the above, plus `rm -rf "$ATELIER_CONFIG_DIR"`.
- Requires explicit confirmation prompt: *"This will permanently delete all chat history, sessions, plans, and backups under `<path>`. Type 'PURGE' (uppercase) to confirm."*.
- Non-interactive `--purge --yes` is allowed, but the operator must explicitly opt in to both flags.

**Acceptance:** `atelier-uninstall` from any shell removes atelier's shellrc footprint, symlinks, and plugin install — without touching the operator's chat sessions by default. `atelier-uninstall --purge` (with confirmation) wipes everything. After a default uninstall, re-installing atelier via `install.sh` picks up the same `$ATELIER_CONFIG_DIR` and does NOT require re-authenticating to Claude (auth tokens persist in `$ATELIER_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json`).

**Trigger to revisit:** when an operator (including the maintainer) needs to decommission atelier without losing chat history. Captured post-M5.0 alongside M5.0.2 as the natural pair of install-side and uninstall-side hardening.

### M4.14 — Implement↔validate inner loop with iteration budget

The `/next-task` chain currently runs implementation and validation as a single forward pass. Any failure (lint, typecheck, unit tests) falls through to the `retry-with-logs` skill, which resets the worktree and restarts the entire task. There is no cheap inner loop where the implementer can iterate against quick validation before committing to the heavier PR-gate path.

This task introduces an explicit implement↔validate loop driven by `task-orchestrator`, separating fast checks (run on every iteration) from slow checks (run once, before PR):

1. **`/validate`** — new slash command that runs the **fast** validation layer (lint + typecheck + unit/integration tests) and prints a structured result (pass/fail + per-check output). Invocable standalone for manual debug.
2. **`/validate --full`** — adds the **slow** layer (Playwright e2e + screenshot capture). Run once before `/pr-flow`, never inside the loop.
3. **`task-orchestrator` loop logic** — after `implementer` returns, the orchestrator calls `/validate`. On fail, it re-invokes `implementer` with the validation output appended to the prompt (so the next attempt sees what failed). The loop counter is anchored to the existing 3+3 retry budget from [PLAN.md §8](PLAN.md): up to 3 inner iterations → trigger `retry-with-logs` worktree reset → up to 3 more inner iterations → hard stop with the existing `blocked` issue path.
4. **Iteration counter** — persisted at `<worktree>/.task-log/attempt-count` so a session restart does not silently reset the budget.

The hook-driven variant (auto-reprompt on `Stop`) is captured separately as M4.15 — alternative path, not a replacement for the orchestrator-driven loop.

**Acceptance:**

- `/validate` exists as a standalone command and prints a structured pass/fail summary.
- Running `/next-task` on a task whose first implementation attempt fails lint/typecheck/unit-tests triggers an automatic in-place re-implementation **without** a worktree reset, up to 3 times.
- On the 4th failure, `retry-with-logs` resets the worktree and iteration 4 begins fresh; iterations 4–6 follow the same inner-loop pattern.
- On the 7th total failure, the task is marked `[BLOCKED]` with the existing GitHub issue flow (must not regress).
- `task-orchestrator` prompt explicitly documents the loop contract and the counter location.

**Trigger to revisit:** when an implementation attempt routinely fails on issues that do not require a full worktree reset to fix (typos, missing imports, lint-only). Identified in conversation 2026-05-21 — the current single-pass-then-reset flow over-rotates on full resets when a cheap inner loop would catch most trivial mistakes.

### M4.17 — `docker-env` skill + `docker-runner` agent (on-demand local containers)

Sonnet agent + skill for on-demand Docker container management during task execution. The agent scaffolds `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml`; the skill drives lifecycle (`up`/`down`/`logs`/`ps`) scoped to the task worktree. Daily-work productivity tool — useful when a task needs to test against Postgres, Redis, or a similar service without contaminating the operator's machine.

- [ ] **`docker-runner` agent (Sonnet)** — authors `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, pins base image tags, declares services / env / ports / healthchecks. Image choices follow [PLAN.md §4](PLAN.md) dep-install rules (justify in commit, prefer official images, avoid <7-day-old tags).
- [ ] **`docker-env` skill** — compose project name = `<task-id>-<slug>` so parallel tasks isolate networks/volumes; lifecycle commands `up`, `down`, `logs <service>`, `ps`. Auto-discovered and invoked by `implementer` when the task needs services.
- [ ] **Runtime detection** — probe `docker info` at first use; fail with a clear actionable message if no daemon is running. `install.sh` does **not** install Colima or Docker Desktop — the operator chooses and installs a runtime; the skill works against whichever daemon is reachable.
- [ ] **Permissions delta in `settings.template.json`** — `Edit(<worktree>/**/Dockerfile)` and `Edit(<worktree>/**/docker-compose*)` auto-allowed inside the task worktree; [PLAN.md §3](PLAN.md) "ask" remains for any path outside the worktree. [PLAN.md §6](PLAN.md) auto-merge block for Dockerfile / docker-compose* stays in force — PRs touching these files still fall back to human review.
- [ ] **`Stop` hook** — tears down the task's containers and removes named volumes prefixed with `<task-id>` on session end, so no orphans accumulate.

**Acceptance:** in a toy repo with no Docker config, a task that requires Postgres ends with the agent having generated `docker-compose.yml`, the skill having started the service, tests passing against it, and the `Stop` hook cleaning everything up — leaving no orphan containers, networks, or volumes. A PR touching `docker-compose.yml` still falls back to human review per PLAN.md §6.

**Trigger to revisit:** the first time a task needs to test against a containerized service and the operator would otherwise write Docker config by hand. Captured 2026-05-22 as a daily-work productivity tool that complements (not blocks) the core agent flow.

## Low Priority / Ideas

> **Phases 5–7 + deferred v2 patterns.** Multi-project, docs, end-to-end validation, and the OMC-borrowed ideas from PLAN.md §11.

### M4.4 — Blocked-task visibility in `/status`

Extend the existing `/status` command so it also lists tasks currently marked `[BLOCKED]` in `IN_PROGRESS.md`, with their issue URL and the count of attached `.task-log/*.md` entries. Today the operator only sees blocked tasks by filtering GitHub Issues by label `blocked` or by reading `IN_PROGRESS.md` manually — neither is discoverable from inside a Claude session.

**Acceptance:** `/status` on a project with N blocked tasks prints `Blocked: N` followed by one line per task with `<id> — <title> — <issue-url>`.

**Trigger to revisit:** when the operator starts having more than ~2 blocked tasks open simultaneously and finding them becomes friction. Identified while designing M4.2 — deferred because the M4.2 + M4.3 loop is functional without it; this is pure quality-of-life.

### M4.5 — `/abandon-task <id>`

A slash command for the Camino C of the blocked-task lifecycle (operator decides the task will not be retried). Today this requires the operator to (a) close the GitHub `blocked` issue with a `wontfix` comment and (b) manually move the entry from `IN_PROGRESS.md` to `HISTORY.md` with an "abandoned" note. The command automates both steps:

1. Close the GitHub `blocked` issue with a `wontfix` reason comment.
2. Move the `[BLOCKED]` entry from `IN_PROGRESS.md` to `HISTORY.md` under an explicit `### <id> — <title> — abandoned — <date>` heading.
3. Preserve the `.task-log/` directory inside the worktree (post-mortem evidence stays in case the task is ever revived) and `git wt rm` the worktree only after the operator confirms.

**Acceptance:** running `/abandon-task <id>` on a `[BLOCKED]` entry closes the issue with `wontfix`, moves the entry to `HISTORY.md` with `abandoned` mark, and removes the worktree (with confirmation).

**Trigger to revisit:** after M4.2 + M4.3 land and the operator hits a real "I'm not retrying this" situation. Identified while designing M4.2 — deferred because the manual workaround (close issue + edit two markdown files) works fine for the rare case where a task is genuinely abandoned.

### M4.15 — `Stop`-hook auto-reprompt on validation failure (exceptional path)

`blocked_by: M4.14`

Complement to M4.14. Where M4.14 puts the implement↔validate loop inside `task-orchestrator` (the orchestrator reads the validation output and decides whether to re-invoke `implementer`), M4.15 explores doing the same thing one layer lower — at the harness level, via a `Stop` hook that triggers automatically when an assistant turn ends with a failed validation.

The hook script:

1. Detects that the last turn ran `/validate` (or `/validate --full`) and the exit was failure.
2. Reads `<worktree>/.task-log/attempt-count` and increments it. If the count exceeds the 3+3 budget, the hook does **nothing** — the orchestrator-side `blocked` issue path takes over.
3. Emits a structured retry prompt back to Claude containing:
   - An explicit `RETRY-attempt-N / 6` header (so the model knows this is not a fresh task and how much budget remains).
   - The full output of the failed validation (stdout + stderr from the failing checks) verbatim.
   - A directive: *"the previous attempt failed the checks below — correct the issues without restarting the task; do not reset the worktree".*

This is **not** the primary loop mechanism (M4.14 is). It is captured as an alternative for cases where the orchestrator-driven loop is too high-latency (long agent dispatch overhead per turn) or where the operator wants the loop to keep running across session restarts without re-entering `/next-task`.

**Acceptance:**

- A `Stop` hook script under `hooks/` detects validation-failure conditions and emits a structured retry prompt with `RETRY-attempt-N` framing and the previous validation output verbatim.
- The hook respects the same 3+3 budget anchored to `<worktree>/.task-log/attempt-count` (the file written by M4.14) — never exceeds it, never bypasses the `blocked` issue path.
- Hook is **opt-in** (off by default), enabled via a per-project setting or env var — atelier ships without it active to avoid surprising the operator.
- When active, the hook composes with M4.14 cleanly (no double-incrementing the counter, no race between orchestrator-driven and hook-driven reprompts).

**Trigger to revisit:** after M4.14 is in production and the operator observes that orchestrator dispatch latency dominates iteration time, **or** wants the loop to survive a session restart. Captured in conversation 2026-05-21 as an exceptional-case mechanism — the operator likes the idea but explicitly tagged it as "for later".

### M5.1 — Project registry

`~/.claude-work/projects.json` tracks every project the operator has set up. Fields per project: path, name, last-task timestamp, setup version.

### M5.2 — `/setup-project` full bootstrap

Extend the Phase 2 command to be the canonical multi-project entry point: registers in `projects.json`, creates `.claude/settings.json`, project `ROADMAP.md`, project `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, project `.npmrc` (pnpm guardrails), `.gitignore` entries.

### M5.3 — `task` alias resolves project from cwd

Shell alias detects which registered project the cwd belongs to and opens a Claude session that auto-invokes `/next-task` for that project. Falls back to a project-picker menu if cwd is not inside a registered project.

### M6.1 — `update.sh`

Incremental updater per [PLAN.md §9](PLAN.md): `git pull` → diff changed files → apply deltas → if `settings.template.json` changed, prompt the operator with a human-readable permissions diff (added / removed / impact) before applying.

### M6.2 — Operator guide

Junior-friendly walkthrough: clone → install → first task. No git/branching/PR jargon.

### M6.3 — Product owner guide (ROADMAP.md format)

How to write [PLAN.md §5](PLAN.md)-shaped roadmaps: priorities, types, estimates, `blocked_by`, acceptance criteria. With examples.

### M6.4 — Troubleshooting doc

Common failure modes and recovery: auth expired, plugin not loading, hooks blocking unexpectedly, `git-wt` misconfigured, `.npmrc` guardrail false-positives.

Two specific items captured during dogfood-1 that belong here:

- **GitHub same-identity self-approval limitation.** When `pr-author` and `reviewer` run under the same GitHub identity (the operator's, in single-developer projects), GitHub silently downgrades the reviewer's `gh pr review --approve` to a comment, which trips both auto-merge guardrails #2 (review status) and #6 (pending human comment). The auto-merge skill is correct to hold the PR. Two operator-side mitigations to document: (a) configure a separate bot identity for `atelier:reviewer` (recommended for ≥1 active project), or (b) accept that single-developer projects always merge manually and add `--squash --delete-branch` to the operator's muscle memory. Identified in dogfood-1 (Finding #11).
- **Claude Code permission-cache mis-alignment after worktree reset.** When `retry-with-logs` triggers the reset between attempt 03 and 04, the worktree is recreated via `git worktree remove --force` + `git worktree add`. The harness's permission cache continues to apply the pre-reset deny list against the recreated worktree path inconsistently — in dogfood-1, two separate `Edit` calls on a deny-listed path succeeded in attempts 04 and 05 (and were reverted to honor the hard refusal). Mitigation until Claude Code fixes the harness: between attempt 03 and attempt 04, the operator should restart the Claude Code session, or the orchestrator should surface a warning that enforcement is undefined post-reset. Identified in dogfood-1 (Finding B).

### M7.1 — Dogfood on a real (non-toy) project

Run a full task cycle on an actual project. Capture friction.

### M7.2 — Iterate the network allowlist

Grow the allowlist organically based on what M7.1 needs. Document each addition with a one-line justification.

### M7.3 — Measure autonomous merge rate

Sample 10 real tasks; compute the % that reach merged state without human intervention. Target ≥80%.

### v2 ideas (deferred)

Per [PLAN.md §11](PLAN.md). Revisit only after v1 is stable.

- v2.1 — Skill auto-injector hook (`UserPromptSubmit`) to load skills by context signals.
- v2.2 — Router skill with subcommands (`/atelier setup|doctor|update|reconfigure`).
- v2.3 — `PermissionRequest` Bash hook for dynamic permissions, replacing static `settings.template.json`.
- v2.4 — Project-memory hooks (`SessionStart` + `PostToolUse`) to auto-persist project learnings.
- v2.5 — `/learner` + `/skillify` to extract reusable patterns from successful tasks.
- v2.6 — Node.js hook dispatcher (`scripts/run.cjs`) for portable, fail-open hook execution.

### Out of scope for v1

Per [PLAN.md §11](PLAN.md). Listed here so they are not picked up by accident: multi-repo coordination, deployment/release management, cost monitoring / per-task budgets, visual regression baselines, ROADMAP ↔ Issues bidirectional sync.
