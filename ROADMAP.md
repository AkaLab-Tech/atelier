# Roadmap

Backlog of work for this project. Tasks flow: `ROADMAP.md` → `IN_PROGRESS.md` → `HISTORY.md`.

Each task lives here as a heading with whatever description it needs (acceptance criteria, design notes, sub-tasks). When work starts, move the block to `IN_PROGRESS.md`.

Tasks are derived from the implementation plan in [PLAN.md §12](PLAN.md). Milestone IDs (M1.1, M2.3, …) refer to that plan and are kept in titles for traceability. Always read the referenced PLAN.md section before starting a task.

---

## High Priority

> **Phase 1 — Foundation.** Blocks everything else. A fresh Mac must be able to run `install.sh`, log in to Claude + GitHub, and end with the `atelier` plugin installed and `/doctor` ✅.

---

## Medium Priority

> **Phases 2–4 — Single-project agent flow + robustness.** Done when the toy-repo flow can pick a task, implement it, open a reviewed PR, auto-merge it, clean up, and survive failures with retries.


### M4.2 — `unblocker` agent

On hard stop, opens a `blocked` issue on GitHub with all `.task-log` entries attached, notifies the operator, and moves the orchestrator to the next task.

**Acceptance:** the 6-failure scenario from M4.1 ends with a `blocked` issue created and the next task picked up.

### M4.3 — `/resume-task <id>`

Continue a task after interruption: re-attach to its worktree, replay context from logs, resume from the last successful step.

**Acceptance:** killing a session mid-task and running `/resume-task <id>` continues without re-running already-completed steps.

---

## Low Priority / Ideas

> **Phases 5–7 + deferred v2 patterns.** Multi-project, docs, end-to-end validation, and the OMC-borrowed ideas from PLAN.md §11.

### M4.4 — Blocked-task visibility in `/status`

Extend the existing `/status` command so it also lists tasks currently marked `[BLOCKED]` in `IN_PROGRESS.md`, with their issue URL and the count of attached `.task-log/*.md` entries. Today the operator only sees blocked tasks by filtering GitHub Issues by label `blocked` or by reading `IN_PROGRESS.md` manually — neither is discoverable from inside a Claude session.

**Acceptance:** `/status` on a project with N blocked tasks prints `Blocked: N` followed by one line per task with `<id> — <title> — <issue-url>`.

**Trigger to revisit:** when the operator starts having more than ~2 blocked tasks open simultaneously and finding them becomes friction. Identified while designing M4.2 — deferred because the M4.2 + M4.3 loop is functional without it; this is pure quality-of-life.

### M4.5 — `/abandon-task <id>`

A slash command for the Camino C of the blocked-task lifecycle (operator decides the task will not be retried). Today this requires the operator to (a) close the GitHub `blocked` issue with a `wontfix` comment and (b) manually move the entry from `IN_PROGRESS.md` to `HISTORY.md` with an "abandoned" note. The command automates both steps:

1. Close the GitHub `blocked` issue with a `wontfix` reason comment.
2. Move the `[BLOCKED]` entry from `IN_PROGRESS.md` to `HISTORY.md` under an explicit `### <id> — <title> — abandoned — <date>` heading.
3. Preserve the `.task-log/` directory inside the worktree (post-mortem evidence stays in case the task is ever revived) and `git wt rm` the worktree only after the operator confirms.

**Acceptance:** running `/abandon-task <id>` on a `[BLOCKED]` entry closes the issue with `wontfix`, moves the entry to `HISTORY.md` with `abandoned` mark, and removes the worktree (with confirmation).

**Trigger to revisit:** after M4.2 + M4.3 land and the operator hits a real "I'm not retrying this" situation. Identified while designing M4.2 — deferred because the manual workaround (close issue + edit two markdown files) works fine for the rare case where a task is genuinely abandoned.

### M5.1 — Project registry

`~/.claude-work/projects.json` tracks every project the operator has set up. Fields per project: path, name, last-task timestamp, setup version.

### M5.2 — `/setup-project` full bootstrap

Extend the Phase 2 command to be the canonical multi-project entry point: registers in `projects.json`, creates `.claude/settings.json`, project `ROADMAP.md`, project `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, project `.npmrc` (pnpm guardrails), `.gitignore` entries.

### M5.3 — `task` alias resolves project from cwd

Shell alias detects which registered project the cwd belongs to and opens a Claude session that auto-invokes `/next-task` for that project. Falls back to a project-picker menu if cwd is not inside a registered project.

### M6.1 — `update.sh`

Incremental updater per [PLAN.md §9](PLAN.md): `git pull` → diff changed files → apply deltas → if `settings.template.json` changed, prompt the operator with a human-readable permissions diff (added / removed / impact) before applying.

### M6.2 — Operator guide

Junior-friendly walkthrough: clone → install → first task. No git/branching/PR jargon.

### M6.3 — Product owner guide (ROADMAP.md format)

How to write [PLAN.md §5](PLAN.md)-shaped roadmaps: priorities, types, estimates, `blocked_by`, acceptance criteria. With examples.

### M6.4 — Troubleshooting doc

Common failure modes and recovery: auth expired, plugin not loading, hooks blocking unexpectedly, `git-wt` misconfigured, `.npmrc` guardrail false-positives.

### M7.1 — Dogfood on a real (non-toy) project

Run a full task cycle on an actual project. Capture friction.

### M7.2 — Iterate the network allowlist

Grow the allowlist organically based on what M7.1 needs. Document each addition with a one-line justification.

### M7.3 — Measure autonomous merge rate

Sample 10 real tasks; compute the % that reach merged state without human intervention. Target ≥80%.

### v2 ideas (deferred)

Per [PLAN.md §11](PLAN.md). Revisit only after v1 is stable.

- v2.1 — Skill auto-injector hook (`UserPromptSubmit`) to load skills by context signals.
- v2.2 — Router skill with subcommands (`/atelier setup|doctor|update|reconfigure`).
- v2.3 — `PermissionRequest` Bash hook for dynamic permissions, replacing static `settings.template.json`.
- v2.4 — Project-memory hooks (`SessionStart` + `PostToolUse`) to auto-persist project learnings.
- v2.5 — `/learner` + `/skillify` to extract reusable patterns from successful tasks.
- v2.6 — Node.js hook dispatcher (`scripts/run.cjs`) for portable, fail-open hook execution.

### Out of scope for v1

Per [PLAN.md §11](PLAN.md). Listed here so they are not picked up by accident: multi-repo coordination, deployment/release management, cost monitoring / per-task budgets, visual regression baselines, ROADMAP ↔ Issues bidirectional sync.
