### M2.4 — Phase 2 hooks (dynamic security layer: `block-env-commit`, `safe-commit`, `scan-edit-write`, `scan-git-add`, `safe-package-change`) — 2026-05-19
**PRs:** [#22](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/22) (block-env-commit + shared logging) · [#23](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/23) (safe-commit) · [#24](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/24) (scan-edit-write) · [#25](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/25) (scan-git-add) · [#26](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/26) (safe-package-change + this closure)

Final Phase 2 milestone. The five `PreToolUse` hooks that make atelier's defence-in-depth real: the static permissions matrix from M1.4 gates *which* tool an agent can call; this suite gates *with what content* the allowed call may proceed (PLAN.md §3 "Defense-in-depth"). Shipped across five sub-PRs because each hook's pattern catalogue is its own reviewable security surface; the threat-model addendum in PLAN.md §3 (finalised in M1.6) is the authoritative spec each catalogue maps to 1:1.

**Delivered:**
- `hooks/lib/log-decision.sh` (sub-PR 1) — sourceable helper. `log_decision <hook> <tool> <pattern> <action> <message>` appends one JSON line per decision to `<worktree>/.task-log/hook-decisions.jsonl`. Resolves the log path via `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (falls back to `$PWD`). Fail-soft: missing `jq`, unwritable log dir, missing path all return 0 — a hook must never abort because of a logging hiccup, and the unblocker agent (M4.2) reads the JSONL to escalate to blocked issues.
- `hooks/block-env-commit.sh` (sub-PR 1) — `PreToolUse` on Bash. Three detection paths for `.env*` in `git add` / `git commit`: literal path tokens, wildcard adds (`-A`/`.`/`--all`) resolved via `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`, and already-staged paths via `git diff --cached`. Exit 2 with a precise message; the operator sees the offending path and the recovery hint.
- `hooks/safe-commit.sh` (sub-PR 2) — `PreToolUse` on Bash for `git commit`. Walks up looking for `package.json`, runs `pnpm run lint → typecheck → test` in order, stops on first red, returns truncated output. Steps without a matching `scripts.<name>` are N/A and continue (mirrors the M2.2 skill's contract). Escape hatch `ATELIER_SKIP_SAFE_COMMIT=1` documented in the script header. Naming collision with `skills/safe-commit/SKILL.md` (M2.2) is intentional: skill = deliberate (invoked by `pr-author`), hook = automatic (every `git commit`); both implement the same PLAN.md §6 rule at different layers.
- `hooks/scan-edit-write.sh` + `hooks/patterns/scan-edit-write.json` (sub-PR 3) — `PreToolUse` on `Edit | Write | MultiEdit`. Resolves the **proposed** content per tool (`Write.content`, `Edit.new_string`, `MultiEdit.edits[].new_string` concatenated), applies skips (`path_substrings`, `basename_prefixes`, content directive), then walks the externalised 8-pattern catalogue: 6 Block (eval/exec of user input, hardcoded secrets generic + known-prefix, Python eval) and 2 Warn (SQL/shell injection shapes, CSP relaxation).
- `hooks/scan-git-add.sh` + `hooks/patterns/scan-git-add.json` (sub-PR 4) — `PreToolUse` on Bash for `git add`. Three-phase scan per resolved path: file-level (path patterns: `.env*`, `secrets/`, `credentials/`), added-line-level (regex for AWS access keys, GitHub fine-grained PATs, substring for private-key headers, plus Shannon-entropy heuristic for ≥ 32 base64-ish runs on non-comment lines), and **reused** content scan from the scan-edit-write catalogue. Entropy calculation runs in Python with content passed via tmpfile (early version hit a HEREDOC-vs-stdin conflict — fixed mid-PR). The `Ask` action is implemented as stdout JSON `{"permissionDecision":"ask",...}` per the Claude Code hooks reference.
- `hooks/safe-package-change.sh` + `hooks/patterns/safe-package-change.json` (sub-PR 5) — `PreToolUse` on Bash for `pnpm install`/`add`/`update`/`run` and any `rm pnpm-lock.yaml`. Eight patterns: non-ASCII package name (Block, homoglyph defence), typosquatting via Levenshtein distance ≤ 2 against a 44-package curated list (Ask), package age < 7 days via `pnpm view <pkg> time` (Block, mirrors `.npmrc minimum-release-age=10080`), lifecycle script with `curl|sh`/`wget|sh`/`eval $(curl`/`node -e require('https` patterns (Block), lifecycle script presence not on the native-build allowlist (`sharp`/`puppeteer`/`playwright`/`node-gyp`/etc.) (Ask), `bin` path traversal `../` or `/` prefix (Block), non-registry version specifier (`git+`/`file:`/non-npmjs URL/tarball) (Ask), and explicit lockfile removal (Block).
- `hooks/hooks.json` — extended across the five sub-PRs to register every hook with the appropriate matcher. Final state: 1 `SessionStart` (from M1.5) + 5 `PreToolUse` entries (4 Bash + 1 Edit|Write|MultiEdit). Multiple Bash matchers coexist and all fire on every Bash call; each script filters its own subcommand of interest.
- `.gitignore` — `.task-log/` added (sub-PR 1) so the JSONL never accidentally enters version control.

**Tests:** every hook smoke-tested with synthetic stdin payloads covering its Block / Warn / Ask / Allow / Skip branches.
- sub-PR 1: 6 scenarios (`git add .env`, wildcards, chained commands).
- sub-PR 2: 7 scenarios (no package.json / empty scripts / passing lint / failing lint with truncated output / `ATELIER_SKIP_SAFE_COMMIT`).
- sub-PR 3: 20 scenarios (one positive per Block + Warn pattern, three negatives, five skips, Edit + MultiEdit variants).
- sub-PR 4: 13 scenarios across path-level, added-line, Ask (high-entropy with realistic 4.75-bit base64-ish string), reused scan-edit-write patterns, skips (snapshot files, lockfiles), wildcard catch.
- sub-PR 5: 17 scenarios across all 8 patterns (with mocked `pnpm view` for the four that need remote queries).

`shellcheck` clean on every script (only the expected `SC1091` info about the `source` directive). `jq empty` clean on every JSON.

**Decisions captured across the five PRs:**
- **`path_globs` from threat-model implemented as `path_substrings`** in both content-scanning catalogues. Bash glob-to-regex is fragile (especially `**`); the substring set covers the same files for these patterns. JSON `skips_note` field explains the mapping.
- **Pattern catalogues externalised in `hooks/patterns/<hook>.json`**, not inlined in bash. The patterns are the security surface and deserve to be reviewable independently.
- **`Ask` exit shape uses Claude Code's documented JSON output** (`{"permissionDecision":"ask",...}` on stdout) rather than a bash exit code, because the bash convention for hooks is exit 0 (allow) or 2 (block) only.
- **Naming collision `safe-commit` skill vs hook is intentional.** Skill is deliberate, hook is automatic; both implement PLAN.md §6 push gate at different layers. Documented inline in both files.
- **HEREDOC + pipe stdin compete in bash.** Bit me in scan-git-add's first version where `python3 - <<'PY' ... PY` ate the content the script was piping. Fixed with a tmpfile passed as arg 2.
- **`*"git add ."*` glob is too greedy** (matches `git add .env`). Replaced with a regex word-bounded matcher in scan-git-add after smoke test caught it.
- **BSD `date %3N` and BSD grep `\xNN` don't expand on macOS.** Both bit the implementation; log-decision falls back to second precision for the timestamp, scan-edit-write/safe-package-change use `[^ -~]` (printable-ASCII complement) instead of `\x` ranges.
- **`jq -e ... /dev/null` returns rc=4** (no JSON input); use `jq -en` (null-input mode) when only `--arg`/`--argjson` provide the data. Cost: one false-positive ask on every allowlisted package in safe-package-change before the fix.

**Acceptance criteria from the ROADMAP entry, all satisfied:**
- `git add .env` is blocked with a clear message → ✓ (block-env-commit + scan-git-add env-file-added, double defence).
- `git commit` is blocked when lint or tests fail → ✓ (safe-commit hook).
- Three content-scanning hooks reject deterministic positive cases (planted secret, planted `eval(stdin)`, planted `"postinstall": "curl … | sh"`) and pass clean cases → ✓ (all three smoke-tested with the canonical fixture shapes from the addendum).

**Phase 2 (Single-project agent flow) closed with this PR.** All four M2.x milestones merged: M2.1 (#19), M2.2 (#20), M2.3 (#21), M2.4 (#22 → #26). Next phase: M3.1 (`e2e-runner` agent + `visual-validation` skill — includes installing Playwright + browsers, which was deferred here from M1.3 to keep the install lean for operators who don't run e2e tasks).

**Follow-ups (carried forward into Phase 3+):**
- Dogfood the full chain on a real (non-toy) project (M7.1). All five hooks have been smoke-tested synthetically; a live `pnpm add` against the real npm registry is the missing end-to-end check.
- The `safe-package-change` typosquat list is intentionally minimal (44 entries). It will grow organically as M7.1 surfaces real false positives / true negatives.
- The `safe-commit` hook's default 60s Claude Code timeout will hit on projects with long test suites. The `ATELIER_SKIP_SAFE_COMMIT=1` env-var escape hatch is enough for v1; a more graceful resolution (per-project `hooks/hooks.json` override or progressive gate that runs lint/typecheck first and tests in the background) is a v2 idea.

### M2.3 — Phase 2 slash commands (`/next-task`, `/status`, `/finish-task`, `/setup-project`) — 2026-05-18
**PR:** [#21](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/21)

Third Phase 2 milestone. Materialises the four operator-facing slash commands that drive an atelier task end-to-end. `/doctor` was already delivered in M1.6 (`commands/doctor.md`), so M2.3 effectively scopes to four new commands. Each command is a pure markdown prompt — no auxiliary scripts — that orchestrates the agents (M2.1) and skills (M2.2) already in place.

**Delivered:**
- `commands/next-task.md` (argument-hint `[task-id]`) — full pickup-to-PR flow. Sanity-checks worktree state, refuses to start if `IN_PROGRESS.md` is occupied, invokes the `atelier:task-discovery` skill (or honours an explicit `$ARGUMENTS` id), confirms with the operator before claiming, moves `ROADMAP.md → IN_PROGRESS.md`, creates the worktree via `git-wt`, instantiates `<worktree>/.claude/settings.json` by substituting `<worktree>` in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/settings.template.json` (the placeholder M1.4 left in the matrix), and hands off to the `atelier:task-orchestrator` agent. allowed-tools restricted to read/edit + narrow `Bash(git wt:*)`/`Bash(sed:*)` patterns + `Skill` + `Task`.
- `commands/status.md` (no args, read-only) — single-screen dashboard for the operator. Sections: in-progress task (from `IN_PROGRESS.md`), worktrees (`git wt list` + dirty-check), open PRs (`gh pr list --json …`) split into `task/*` vs out-of-band, blocked-by tasks in `ROADMAP.md`, orphans (worktree without entry / entry without worktree). Never modifies state. Falls back gracefully when `gh` or `git-wt` is unavailable.
- `commands/finish-task.md` (argument-hint `[task-id]`) — finalises the in-progress task. Identifies the task from `IN_PROGRESS.md` + the current branch, runs the push gate via the `atelier:safe-commit` skill (stops on `RED`, asks confirm on `PARTIAL`), invokes `atelier:pr-flow` for the branch → commit → push → PR sequence, and returns the PR URL. Includes a partial-recovery path for the rare push-succeeded-but-PR-not-opened case (Ctrl+C between steps).
- `commands/setup-project.md` (argument-hint `[project-path]`) — initialises a directory for atelier-managed work. Idempotent via `~/.claude/.atelier-config.json` (`projects[<path>] = { setupCompleted, setupVersion }`); if the project is already configured, default is to skip the wizard and offer a reconfigure flow on operator confirmation. Writes `.claude/settings.json` (from `settings.template.json`), creates `ROADMAP.md` + `IN_PROGRESS.md` + `HISTORY.md` if missing (operator-facing template from PLAN.md §5), writes `.claude/CLAUDE.md` that points at the global `operator-rules.md` (no duplication), writes/appends `.npmrc` with the three PLAN.md §4 guardrails (`ignore-scripts=true`, `minimum-release-age=10080`, `audit-level=moderate`), appends `.task-log/`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.DS_Store` to `.gitignore`. Refuses dangerous paths (`/`, `$HOME`, the plugin's own dir).

**Tests:**
- YAML frontmatter parses cleanly for all four commands (Ruby `YAML.safe_load`).
- `argument-hint` and `allowed-tools` fields well-formed; `allowed-tools` follows least-privilege per command (e.g., `/status` allows only `Bash(git wt list)`, `Bash(gh pr list:*)`, no write tools at all).
- Plugin loader discovers all five `commands/*.md` (the four new + `doctor.md` from M1.6) via `claude --plugin-dir <worktree> --permission-mode plan -p "..."`. Auto-discovery same as `agents/` (M2.1) and `skills/` (M2.2) — no entry in `plugin.json` needed.

**Decisions captured:**
- **No auxiliary scripts in `scripts/`.** Each command is a self-contained prompt. `/next-task` uses inline `sed` for the `<worktree>` substitution rather than a `scripts/instantiate-settings.sh` helper — keeps the indirection low and the substitution visible to reviewers. If a command grows complex enough to need a helper, we add it then; not pre-emptively.
- **`/finish-task` does not run `git wt rm` after merge.** The PR may need follow-up commits during review, so deleting the worktree mid-review corrupts the chain. Worktree cleanup is a manual operator step (or a future `/cleanup-task` command); the post-merge instruction lives in the success report so the operator knows when to run it.
- **`/setup-project` defaults to skip-when-configured.** First implementation tried the opposite (always offer reconfigure on re-run) and felt noisy — most re-runs are accidental. Default is now `✓ already configured — nothing to do`, with reconfigure available on explicit request.
- **`/status` is read-only by allowed-tools.** Even surface suggestions (`git wt rm <orphan>`) are printed as text, never executed. This keeps `/status` safe to run reflexively at any moment.

**Acceptance criterion status:** the ROADMAP M2.3 acceptance — *"in a toy repo, `/next-task` runs end-to-end (pick task → worktree → implement → PR draft) without manual intervention"* — is **structurally satisfied** but requires a toy-repo dogfood run to validate end-to-end. Each piece is in place (commands, skills, agents, settings template), so the gap is integration testing, not functionality. Will be exercised during M7.1.

**Follow-ups:**
- Toy-repo dogfood run (M7.1) — validates the full `/next-task → /finish-task` cycle.
- `/cleanup-task <id>` command (post-merge worktree removal + branch deletion) — currently a manual operator step; can be split out if friction surfaces.
- `/resume-task <id>` — referenced by `/next-task` and `/finish-task` but lives in M4.3.

### M2.2 — Phase 2 skills (`task-discovery`, `pr-flow`, `safe-commit`, `safe-install`) — 2026-05-18
**PR:** [#20](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/20)

Second Phase 2 milestone. Materialises the four skills the orchestrator and specialist agents from M2.1 invoke via the `Skill` tool, per [PLAN.md §7](PLAN.md). The `git-wt` skill is **not** in this PR — it ships from the external [Miguelslo27/git-wt](https://github.com/Miguelslo27/git-wt) package (installed by `install.sh` Phase C.1, not maintained here).

**Delivered:**
- `skills/task-discovery/SKILL.md` — parses the operator-facing `ROADMAP.md` format from [PLAN.md §5](PLAN.md) (P0/P1/P2 sections with `bug`/`feat`/`chore`/`docs`/`refactor` type tags, `#id`, `~estimate`, `blocked_by:` metadata) and picks the highest-priority unblocked item. Returns a structured record (`id`, `title`, `type`, `priority`, `estimate`, `blocked_by`, `worktree` slug, `acceptance`, `context`) so the orchestrator can route the task. Handles the dual layout — operator-facing P0/P1/P2 in target projects, simpler High/Medium/Low in atelier's own repo — and refuses to pick a task when every unchecked item is blocked.
- `skills/pr-flow/SKILL.md` — branch → commit → push → PR recipe, executable form of [PLAN.md §6](PLAN.md). Step-by-step: stage explicit paths (never `-A`), Conventional Commits message via HEREDOC, push only to `origin task/<id>-<slug>`, move `IN_PROGRESS.md` → `HISTORY.md` in the same PR, open the PR with the standard description shape (Summary / Test plan / Tracking). Hard refusals listed explicitly: no push to protected branches, no `--force`, no `--no-verify`, no `Co-Authored-By` attribution, no marking the PR auto-merge-ready (that gate needs `reviewer` from M3.2), no touching `package.json` / lockfile / workflows / Docker from this flow.
- `skills/safe-commit/SKILL.md` — executable form of the push gate from [PLAN.md §6](PLAN.md). Detects the project's pnpm scripts (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`) with fallback name conventions, runs them in order, stops on first red, returns a structured report (`✓` / `✗` per step + `Result: GREEN | RED`) so callers can parse it deterministically. Allows exactly one retry for suspected flakes; never softens reds, never `--passWithNoTests`, never quarantines tests to make a red go green.
- `skills/safe-install/SKILL.md` — executable form of [PLAN.md §4](PLAN.md). Five-step recipe: (1) self-question whether stdlib / existing utility suffices (lists common false-needs: `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `fetch`, `crypto.randomUUID`, `structuredClone`, `URLSearchParams`), (2) `pnpm view` to compare ≥ 2 alternatives by downloads / last publish / dep tree, (3) hard-fail if `now - published < 7 days`, (4) `pnpm add --lockfile-only` + `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate`, revert lockfile on any moderate+ finding, (5) install + write justification to commit / PR body. Belt-and-braces with the per-project `.npmrc` written by `/setup-project` (M2.3) — never relies on `.npmrc` alone, so the reasoning lives in the PR where reviewers see it.

**Tests:**
- YAML frontmatter parses cleanly for all four files (`ruby -ryaml`).
- `description` block scalars use `>-` (folded, strip) where the prose contains `:` characters — initial attempt with plain inline `description: <text>` failed YAML parsing for `pr-flow` and `safe-install` because of unquoted colons after "PLAN.md §6" / "§4"; fixed in the same PR.
- Each skill: name + description well-formed, body 86–156 lines (well under the 500-line ideal from `skill-creator`'s guidance), description 680–857 chars (well above the 10-char minimum, below the 5000-char ceiling), each starting with the action verb and explicitly listing trigger phrases per skill-creator's "pushy description" guidance.
- Plugin loader picks them up via auto-discovery (no entry needed in `plugin.json`, same auto-scan behaviour as `agents/` confirmed in M2.1 and `skills/` confirmed since M1.2).

**Decisions captured:**
- **No `references/` or `scripts/` directories yet.** Each SKILL.md is a single self-contained markdown file. The `skill-creator` recommends progressive disclosure (split into `references/<topic>.md` for larger reference material, `scripts/<task>.py` for deterministic helpers), but all four skills fit comfortably under 500 lines — adding hierarchy now would be premature.
- **`safe-install` writes the justification into the commit/PR body, not into a separate file.** The reasoning is the audit trail; burying it in a metadata file makes it invisible to reviewers. PLAN.md §4 step 3 says "justify in commit / PR description" — this skill enforces that literal interpretation.
- **`pr-flow` keeps the PR description schema explicit.** Reviewers should not have to guess which template a PR follows. Future skills (`/finish-task`, `pr-author`) will be added; the schema lives in one place so all callers produce the same shape.
- **`pr-flow` description reinforced after the manual smoke test surfaced under-triggering.** Initial wording overlapped heavily with what `operator-rules.md` (SessionStart hook from M1.5) already covers — Claude responded correctly from the hook's context without loading the SKILL.md body, even for ejecutive prompts ("open the PR for me"). Fixed by adding an explicit "ALWAYS load this skill before running any of `git add` / `git commit` / `git push` / `gh pr create`" instruction and naming `operator-rules.md` directly so Claude understands the skill **complements** the hook (the hook is summary, the skill is executable detail — HEREDOC templates, `gh pr create` body shape, hard-refusal list). `task-discovery` and `safe-commit` triggered cleanly from the start because their bodies contain content not present anywhere else in context (the §5 parsing algorithm; the GREEN/RED report schema with N/A handling). `safe-install` triggered cleanly because its stdlib-check catalogue (`Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `crypto.randomUUID`, `structuredClone`, etc.) is unique to the skill. General lesson: a skill description must promise something the SessionStart-loaded context cannot deliver, otherwise Claude will (correctly) skip it.

**Follow-ups:**
- Acceptance criterion *"exercised by at least one slash command"* — blocked on M2.3 (`/next-task`, `/finish-task` will be the canonical callers for `task-discovery` and `pr-flow` respectively).
- `safe-install` step 4 needs validation against a real `pnpm audit` output. Will be exercised when the first toy-repo dependency install happens during M7.1 dogfooding.

### M2.1 — Phase 2 agents (`task-orchestrator`, `implementer`, `tester`, `pr-author`) — 2026-05-18
**PR:** [#19](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/19)

First Phase 2 milestone. Materialises the four agents that drive an atelier task through the chain `task-orchestrator` (Opus) → `implementer` (Sonnet) → `tester` (Sonnet) → `pr-author` (Sonnet), per [PLAN.md §7](PLAN.md). e2e-runner, reviewer, and unblocker are out of scope here (M3.1, M3.2, M4.2).

**Delivered:**
- `agents/task-orchestrator.md` (opus, color `blue`, tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `TodoWrite`, `Task`, `Skill`). Owns the chain: picks the next ROADMAP item via the `task-discovery` skill (when M2.2 lands; fallback today is manual), invokes `git-wt` for isolation, moves the block from `ROADMAP.md` → `IN_PROGRESS.md`, then delegates to the three specialists sequentially. Enforces the 6-attempt retry budget from [PLAN.md §8](PLAN.md). Does not write code or tests itself.
- `agents/implementer.md` (sonnet, color `green`, tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `TodoWrite`, `Skill`). Writes the minimum-viable change against the task's acceptance criteria inside the per-task worktree. Refuses to touch `package.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `.github/workflows/**` / `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose*` — those route back to the orchestrator and ultimately a human. Reports `Changes / Verification done locally / Unresolved / Next` back.
- `agents/tester.md` (sonnet, color `yellow`, tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `TodoWrite`). Authors unit + integration tests in the project's existing framework, runs the full lint + typecheck + test push gate from [PLAN.md §6](PLAN.md), and surfaces flakes rather than masking them. e2e/Playwright explicitly deferred to `e2e-runner` (M3.1).
- `agents/pr-author.md` (sonnet, color `cyan`, tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash`, `TodoWrite`, `Skill`). Re-runs the push gate one more time, composes a Conventional Commits message, pushes only to `origin task/<id>-<slug>`, opens the PR via `gh pr create` with the standard description (roadmap ref, summary, validation checklist, screenshots placeholder), and moves the block from `IN_PROGRESS.md` → `HISTORY.md` in the same PR. Explicitly does **not** mark the PR auto-merge-ready (that gate requires `reviewer` from M3.2).

**Tests:** YAML frontmatter parses cleanly for all four files (`ruby -ryaml`). The official `plugin-dev` plugin's `validate-agent.sh` script passes on all four with only 3 cosmetic warnings — those are a false-positive from the script extracting only the first line of `description:` block scalars (`description: |`), the same shape used by Claude's own canonical `agent-creator.md` example. Tools list contains only known Claude Code tool names (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `TodoWrite`, `Task`, `Skill`). End-to-end agent invocation will be exercised when M2.3 `/next-task` lands and the orchestrator can be reached from a slash command.

**Decisions captured:**
- **Operator rules not duplicated in each agent prompt.** PLAN.md §4 / §6 / §8 already load globally via the M1.5 `SessionStart` hook (`operator-rules.md`). Each agent's system prompt cites those sections by reference rather than re-stating them, so updates to the operator rules propagate without touching every agent file.
- **`Skill` and `Task` in the orchestrator's tool list, not `Agent`.** Claude Code's documented agent-invocation tool name inside an agent definition is `Task`; `Agent` is only the SDK-facing name. The `Skill` tool is what lets the orchestrator invoke `git-wt`, `task-discovery`, `safe-install`, etc.
- **Tester does not get `Skill`.** It does not need to invoke any skill — it operates entirely via `Bash` against the project's `pnpm` scripts. Least privilege.
- **Skeleton `README.md` files from M1.1 removed.** Manual smoke test surfaced that `agents/README.md` was being loaded as a phantom agent (`atelier:README · inherit`) in `/agents`. Same risk applied to `commands/README.md` (slash commands) and `skills/README.md` (skills). All six skeleton READMEs (`agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`) deleted in the same PR — each directory now has real content that documents itself, so the one-line organizational note from M1.1 is no longer needed. Lesson for future skeleton scaffolding: do **not** drop a `README.md` inside a Claude Code auto-discovery directory (`agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`) — it will be parsed as a definition.

**Follow-ups:**
- Real end-to-end smoke test (orchestrator routes implementer → tester → pr-author against a toy ROADMAP item) blocked on M2.2 (skills `task-discovery`, `pr-flow`, `safe-commit`) and M2.3 (`/next-task` slash command). Acceptance criterion "invoked from a slash command" is fully achievable only after M2.3 lands.
- `safe-install` mentions in the implementer/orchestrator prompts are forward references — the actual skill arrives in M2.2.

### M1.6 — `claude-roadmap-tools` extraction + shared catalog + `/doctor` — 2026-05-17
**PRs:** [#1 claude-roadmap-tools](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/claude-roadmap-tools/pull/1) (plugin published) · [#1 claude-plugins](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/claude-plugins/pull/1) (shared catalog) · [#11](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/11) (atelier marketplace.json removed) · [#14](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/14) (install.sh Phase C.2 already installed both plugins via shared catalog) · [#18](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/18) (`/atelier:doctor` + M2.4 threat-model addendum + narrow doctor allows + this closure)

Final Phase 1 milestone. Promotes the ROADMAP/IN_PROGRESS/HISTORY tooling out of the maintainer's `~/.claude-personal/` into a public plugin (`AkaLab-Tech/claude-roadmap-tools`), registers every AkaLab-Tech plugin in a dedicated shared marketplace catalog repo (`AkaLab-Tech/claude-plugins`), drives both installs from `install.sh` Phase C.2, and ships the `/atelier:doctor` health check so operators can detect drift across the three artefacts they depend on (`atelier`, `claude-roadmap-tools`, `git-wt`).

**Delivered:**
- `AkaLab-Tech/claude-roadmap-tools` plugin and `AkaLab-Tech/claude-plugins` catalog repo (done in their own repos; this repo only references them).
- `install.sh` Phase C.2 already installs both plugins via the shared `akalab-tech` catalog (recognised retroactively — actually shipped in PR #14).
- `commands/doctor.md` (~140 lines) — pure-markdown slash command. Invoked as `/atelier:doctor` because Claude Code's built-in `/doctor` (CLI diagnostics) shadows the bare name. Six structured checks: two plugin-drift, one git-wt SHA, three host (legacy hooks / git-wt PATH / shellrc / `.npmrc` / `.atelier-config.json`). Reports `✓`/`✗`/`–` and prints exact remediation commands but never applies them.
- `templates/settings.template.json` allow list extended with 12 narrow patterns covering exactly the commands `/doctor` invokes. `Bash(gh api *)` is deliberately not allowed — only the specific endpoints (`releases/latest`, `tags`, `commits/main`) for the three known repos. Allow count: 50 → 62.
- `PLAN.md` §3 threat-model addendum (~76 lines) listing the exact pattern catalogue each M2.4 `PreToolUse` content-scanning hook checks (`scan-edit-write`, `scan-git-add`, `safe-package-change`) — match heuristic, action (Block/Warn/Ask), known false-positive surfaces per pattern. Implementation guardrails: pattern catalogues live in `hooks/patterns/<hook>.json`; every hook decision logs to `<worktree>/.task-log/hook-decisions.jsonl`. Carryover requirement from PR #16/#17 closed here.

**Tests:** `/atelier:doctor` run end-to-end on the maintainer's mac via `claude --plugin-dir <worktree>`. Produced the expected `✓`/`✗`/`–` report. Detected a real git-wt SHA drift (`ac88a32 → 8a734bc`, the maintainer's own upstream fix to `git wt rm`'s cwd-orphan bug). Plugin checks correctly emitted `–` because AkaLab-Tech/atelier and AkaLab-Tech/claude-roadmap-tools have no published releases/tags yet. Auxiliary checks resolved as expected for the maintainer's environment (`–` for `.npmrc` and `.atelier-config.json` since the maintainer's view is the atelier repo itself, not an operator-managed project).

**Decision captured during the PR:** the bare `/doctor` name collides with Claude Code's built-in `/doctor` (CLI install diagnostics). Plugin slash commands are namespaced as `<plugin-name>:<command-name>`, so `commands/doctor.md` in the atelier plugin is invoked as `/atelier:doctor`. The first end-to-end smoke test surfaced this — the user got the built-in's output instead. Documented in the command's intro paragraph and the PR description.

**Phase 1 (Foundation) closed with this PR.** All six M1.x milestones merged: M1.1 (#4), M1.2 (#5 + #11), M1.3 (six sub-PRs #7/#8/#12/#13/#14/#15), M1.4 (#16), M1.5 (#17), M1.6 (#18). The plugin now installs end-to-end on a clean Mac VM, both plugins coexist via the shared `akalab-tech` catalog, operator rules load via `SessionStart` hook, and `/atelier:doctor` reports drift. Next: Phase 2 (M2.1 agents, M2.2 skills, M2.3 slash commands, M2.4 content-scanning hooks).

**Follow-ups (carried forward):**
- Publish initial `v0.1.0` releases / tags on `AkaLab-Tech/atelier` and `AkaLab-Tech/claude-roadmap-tools` so the plugin drift checks can resolve to `✓`/`✗` instead of `–`. Not blocking — `/doctor` correctly handles the no-releases case today.
- M2.4 implementation will use the threat-model addendum as the authoritative pattern catalogue. The catalogue is reviewable as-is; tuning happens during the per-hook implementation sub-PRs.

### M1.5 — Plugin-shipped operator rules (`SessionStart` hook) — 2026-05-17
**PR:** [#17](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/17)

Single-sub-PR Phase 1 milestone: ship the rules atelier's agents must follow on every task in an atelier-managed project. Mechanism revised mid-PR after re-reading the [Claude Code plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference): a `CLAUDE.md` at the plugin root is **not** loaded as project context — the official path for unconditional context injection is a `SessionStart` hook whose stdout becomes context.

**Delivered:**
- `operator-rules.md` (plugin root) — clean markdown that condenses PLAN.md §4 (dep installs), §6 (push/PR/merge gates), §7 (agent chain), §8 (failure-recovery retry budget) into operator-facing prose (no maintainer content). ~95 lines.
- `hooks/load-operator-rules.sh` — bash script that `cat`s `operator-rules.md` to stdout. Path resolved via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` per the plugins reference. Fails soft on missing file (stderr note + exit 0) so a corrupted plugin never locks the operator out of a session.
- `hooks/hooks.json` — registers the `SessionStart` hook. Uses the documented exec-form command quoting around `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.

**Tests:** end-to-end validated by running `claude --plugin-dir <worktree>` and asking "What are the atelier operator rules?" — Claude responded with a faithful summary of all four sections, including verbatim phrases from `operator-rules.md`, which confirms hook discovery → SessionStart firing → stdout-to-context pipe → on-demand retrieval all work as designed. Also: `bash -n`, `shellcheck` (0.11.0), `jq empty hooks/hooks.json`, direct hook invocation with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=<worktree>`, missing-file fallback exit code.

**Decision captured during the PR:** the ROADMAP M1.5 entry literally said "ship a CLAUDE.md". The investigation surfaced that this approach does not actually load context (per the plugins reference, plugins contribute context via skills / agents / hooks, not CLAUDE.md). The implemented `SessionStart` hook is the official mechanism. Cost: ~500-800 tokens of context per session. Trade-off: token cost for autonomy guarantee accepted, since the rules apply to every atelier task and operators should never have to re-run install.sh to opt in to them.

**Follow-ups:**
- Threat-model addendum for M2.4 content-scanning hooks (carryover from PR #16) — still required before any matcher code in M2.4 lands.

### M1.4 — `settings.template.json` (static permissions matrix) — 2026-05-17
**PR:** [#16](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/16)

Single-sub-PR Phase 1 milestone: materialize the allow / deny / ask permissions matrix from PLAN.md §3 at `templates/settings.template.json`. The template stays a template until M2.3 `/setup-project` / `/next-task` instantiate it per-task with the worktree path injected.

**Delivered:**
- `templates/settings.template.json` — 87 permission rules total: 33 deny, 4 ask, 50 allow. `defaultMode: acceptEdits`. `additionalDirectories: ["<worktree>"]` as the substitution placeholder. Faithful 1-to-1 mapping against PLAN.md §3.
- `PLAN.md` §3 gains a **"Defense-in-depth"** note: this matrix is the static layer (gates *which tool* can be called); the M2.4 hook suite is the dynamic layer (validates *content* of allowed tool calls). Neither alone is enough.
- `ROADMAP.md` M2.4 expanded from 2 hooks to 5 with three new content-scanning hooks — `scan-edit-write`, `scan-git-add`, `safe-package-change` — plus a pre-implementation note requiring a threat-model addendum in PLAN.md §3 before any matcher code lands.

**Tests:** `jq empty` validates the template parses as JSON; a sample instantiation (`sed 's|<worktree>|/tmp/sample|g' …`) substitutes the placeholder in every spot (additionalDirectories, Read/Edit/Write patterns) and the result re-parses cleanly. Real per-task instantiation by Claude Code is exercised when M2.3 `/next-task` lands.

**Decision captured during the PR:** the user pushed back on shipping a static-only permissions model — defense-in-perimeter is not defense-in-depth. The static template ships now; the dynamic content-validation hooks land with M2.4 (scope expanded in the same PR). Both layers must hold for a real attack to land.

**Follow-ups:**
- Threat-model addendum to PLAN.md §3 listing the exact pattern catalogue each M2.4 content-scanning hook checks — required before any matcher code in M2.4 lands.
- Real per-task instantiation validation by `/next-task` (M2.3) — confirms Claude Code accepts the substituted file.

### M1.3 — `install.sh` (Phases A + B + C.1 + C.2) — 2026-05-17
**PRs:** [#7](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/7) (npmrc decision) · [#8](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/8) (Phase A) · [#12](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/12) (Phase B) · [#13](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/13) (Phase C.1) · [#14](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/14) (Phase C.2) · [#15](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/15) (final verification + closure)

Phase 1 milestone: top-level installer that takes a fresh Mac (or Ubuntu best-effort) from "factory" to "ready to run atelier tasks". Implemented across 6 PRs.

**Delivered:**
- `install.sh` (548 lines) with strict mode + helpers + OS detection + 5 phases + verification block.
- **Phase A**: brew (mac) / apt (linux) installs of `git`, `gh`, `fnm`, `jq`, `fzf` + `corepack`-managed `pnpm`. Claude Code via Anthropic's official native installer (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`).
- **Phase B**: Claude OAuth (`claude auth login`) + GitHub HTTPS auth (`gh auth login --git-protocol https --skip-ssh-key`), idempotent via `claude auth status` / `gh auth status`, no-TTY-safe.
- **Phase C.1**: external `git-wt` install + SHA recording in `~/.local/state/atelier/git-wt.sha` for `/doctor` (M1.6); `.env*` in git global excludes; git identity prompts with current values as defaults (per PR #9), no-TTY-safe; shellrc hooks (`fnm env --use-on-cd`, `task() { claude "/next-task $*"; }`, `task-status` alias) injected into `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` via sentinel-bounded idempotent block, with unwritable-shellrc graceful fallback.
- **Phase C.2**: `claude plugin marketplace add AkaLab-Tech/claude-plugins` + `claude plugin install atelier@akalab-tech` + `claude plugin install claude-roadmap-tools@akalab-tech` (CLI verbs, not slash-commands), idempotent via `--json` + `jq`, with missing-claude / unauthed fallback that prints the manual commands and continues.
- **Verification block** (`phase_verify`): 6 `✓`/`✗` checks (`claude --version`, `claude auth status`, `gh auth status`, `git wt help`, both plugins installed) plus an inline note that `/doctor` lands in M1.6.

**Bugs discovered during testing & fixed in-flight:**
- `unzip` missing from apt deps (broke `fnm` install on a clean Ubuntu) — fixed in PR #8 commit `d40dd33`.
- git-wt SHA not recorded on idempotent re-runs (when git-wt was already on PATH from a manual install) — fixed in PR #13.
- Unwritable shellrc caused a fatal error mid-Phase-C.1 — fixed in PR #13 (warn with exact `sudo chown` command, skip, continue, exit 0).

**Decisions captured along the way:**
- npmrc supply-chain guardrails are per-project (written by `/setup-project` in M2.3), not global (PR #7).
- Marketplace name `akalab-tech` differs from plugin name `atelier` to avoid an `atelier@atelier` resolver collision (M1.2 / PR #5).
- Marketplace catalog moved to a dedicated `AkaLab-Tech/claude-plugins` repo so multiple AkaLab-Tech plugins can coexist under one marketplace (PR #11).
- `claude auth login` (CLI verb) instead of `/login` (slash command) for Phase B — slash commands only work inside an interactive `claude` session.
- `claude plugin …` (CLI verbs) instead of `/plugin …` (slash commands) for Phase C.2 — same rationale.

**Tests:** validated on macOS arm64 (Tart clean VM in PR #13 + maintainer's mac end-to-end across every sub-PR) and Ubuntu 24.04 ARM (Multipass clean VM in PR #8). `shellcheck` 0.11.0 clean across every sub-PR.

**Follow-ups:**
- `/doctor` slash command (tracked under M1.6) — turns the verification block into a callable plugin command and adds drift detection against `gh api repos/Miguelslo27/git-wt/commits/main` using the recorded SHA.
- A single clean-Mac-VM end-to-end run on squashed `main` as M7.x dogfood.
- Maintainer's `~/.zshrc` ownership keeps reverting to `root:wheel` periodically — outside atelier's scope, but worth tracking to root-cause (some installer or sudo invocation is touching it).

### M1.2 — Plugin manifest and marketplace — 2026-05-12
**PR:** [#5](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/5)

Second Phase 1 milestone: stand up the plugin manifest and the marketplace catalog so atelier becomes installable via Claude Code's native plugin system.

**Delivered:**
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — name `atelier`, version `0.1.0`, description, author (AkaLab-Tech), homepage, repository, keywords. No `skills` field (the default `skills/` scan path is sufficient; an explicit entry would only add a redundant scan).
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — vendor-scoped marketplace named `akalab-tech` with one plugin entry pointing at `source: "./"`. Plugin and marketplace names intentionally differ to avoid an `atelier@atelier` resolver collision discovered during validation.
- PLAN.md §1 step 11, §12, and ROADMAP.md M1.3 Phase C.2 updated for the new install command (`atelier@akalab-tech`).

**Tests:** end-to-end install validated in an operator Claude Code session — `/plugin marketplace add <worktree-path>` reported `Successfully added marketplace: akalab-tech`, `/plugin install atelier@akalab-tech` reported `✓ Installed atelier`, and `/reload-plugins` ran without manifest errors. `jq empty` validates both JSON files.

**Follow-ups:**
- Global `~/.npmrc` already has `ignore-scripts=true` (the guardrail PLAN.md §2 step 5 will enforce), which breaks the standalone `claude` CLI's native-binary postinstall (the user-facing `/plugin marketplace add` slash command in an existing Claude Code session works fine; only the standalone CLI does not). M1.3 (`install.sh`) must install Claude Code before applying the guardrail, or scope the guardrail to project-level npmrc instead of global.

### M1.1 — Repo skeleton — 2026-05-12
**PR:** [#4](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/4)

First Phase 1 milestone: prepare the on-disk layout the plugin and host-OS layers will populate in M1.2–M1.5.

**Delivered:**
- Created `.claude-plugin/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `templates/`, `scripts/` at the repo root.
- Added a one-line `README.md` to each, naming its purpose.
- Tracking: removed M1.1 from `ROADMAP.md` and routed it through `IN_PROGRESS.md` to this entry.

**Tests:** `ls` shows the seven directories at the repo root; each contains a `README.md` whose first line names its purpose.
