### M1.2 — Plugin manifest and marketplace — 2026-05-12
**PR:** [#5](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/5)

Second Phase 1 milestone: stand up the plugin manifest and the marketplace catalog so atelier becomes installable via Claude Code's native plugin system.

**Delivered:**
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — name `atelier`, version `0.1.0`, description, author (AkaLab-Tech), homepage, repository, keywords. No `skills` field (the default `skills/` scan path is sufficient; an explicit entry would only add a redundant scan).
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — vendor-scoped marketplace named `akalab-tech` with one plugin entry pointing at `source: "./"`. Plugin and marketplace names intentionally differ to avoid an `atelier@atelier` resolver collision discovered during validation.
- PLAN.md §1 step 11, §12, and ROADMAP.md M1.3 Phase C.2 updated for the new install command (`atelier@akalab-tech`).

**Tests:** end-to-end install validated in an operator Claude Code session — `/plugin marketplace add <worktree-path>` reported `Successfully added marketplace: akalab-tech`, `/plugin install atelier@akalab-tech` reported `✓ Installed atelier`, and `/reload-plugins` ran without manifest errors. `jq empty` validates both JSON files.

**Follow-ups:**
- Global `~/.npmrc` already has `ignore-scripts=true` (the guardrail PLAN.md §2 step 5 will enforce), which breaks the standalone `claude` CLI's native-binary postinstall (the user-facing `/plugin marketplace add` slash command in an existing Claude Code session works fine; only the standalone CLI does not). M1.3 (`install.sh`) must install Claude Code before applying the guardrail, or scope the guardrail to project-level npmrc instead of global.

### M1.1 — Repo skeleton — 2026-05-12
**PR:** [#4](https://github.com/AkaLab-Tech/atelier/pull/4)

First Phase 1 milestone: prepare the on-disk layout the plugin and host-OS layers will populate in M1.2–M1.5.

**Delivered:**
- Created `.claude-plugin/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `templates/`, `scripts/` at the repo root.
- Added a one-line `README.md` to each, naming its purpose.
- Tracking: removed M1.1 from `ROADMAP.md` and routed it through `IN_PROGRESS.md` to this entry.

**Tests:** `ls` shows the seven directories at the repo root; each contains a `README.md` whose first line names its purpose.
